	  This driver uses the generic 3gpp AT commands, along
	  with the standard protocols CMUX and PPP, to configure
	  cellular modems to establish a point-to-point
	  network connection. It is a plug-in replacement for the
	  existing GSM_PPP driver, and a template for tailored
	  drivers for the ublox, quectel and other modems, which
	  include power management and more complex device specific
	  features.
